This applicatin is part of the project "Web application performance testing using Angular and React JS", written with use of React. 
The purpose of project was to measure the performance of web applications built with the use of Angular and React JS. Important technical features of the mentioned technologies were analyzed, as well as aspects such as: community support and development, entry threshold, access to programmers and the number of job offers. The paper reviews frontend frameworks and specifies the test methodology. It compares two ways of network communication: REST and web sockets. Test application was created, divided into three projects: frontend with Angular, frontend with React JS, backend with REST and web sockets servers in Node.js and Postgre SQL database. The time of creating the application, its size, as well as the resources consumed by it, time of loading a given page, memory, time of performing specific data operations were compared - creating a query to the server to create, update, read, delete a record from the database, detecting location of the device, sending push notification, adding local storage, searching local storage, rendering an image.
